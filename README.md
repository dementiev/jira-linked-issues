jira-linked-issues
==================

To ease the management of issues and its linked issues, a overall project report should be created. A report
is always executed form the perspective of an issue which is the origin for a link. E.g. Issue A (origin) is
implemented by Issue B (target).

1.	The user configures a search request in the JIRA Issue Navigator. After executing it, all issues
matching the criteria are displayed (regular JIRA function).

3.	The requested report is shown to the user. The report shows all issues found by the issue navigator 
and its linked issues (for each single issue). Doing so the linked issues are displayed below its
corresponding origin issue with some left margin. The margin illustrates the child like relation.
